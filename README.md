# Perceptron_Xor: Learning XOR with a single-layer perceptron is not possible due to its linear nature. The XOR function is not linearly separable,
which means a single perceptron cannot learn to classify XOR inputs correctly.In the new approach using a single-layer perceptron
to learn XOR, we transform the XOR problem into a linearly separable one,making it possible for a single-layer perceptron to learn XOR.
To overcome this limitation, more complex models like multi-layer perceptrons or neural networks with hidden layers are needed 
to successfully learn the XOR function.These models can capture the non-linear relationships present in the XOR problem, 
making it possible to train a neural network to accurately predict XOR outputs.
